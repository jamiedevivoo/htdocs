				<h4>Summary</h4>
					<p>
						Ron Jenkinson was born in Bournemouth in 1933. He was playing outside the front of the house with his brother at the time. It was lunchtime, the town was teeming, people were just getting ready for have their sunday roast. It was likely that these attacks were carefully planned, strategic raids were carried out by pilots who were experienced in attacking at high speed. Despite being three to four miles away from the central attacks, Ron was able to hear the bombs land. He later learned that the Metropole was attacked which housed several canadian soldiers who were killed. His childhood consisted of watching the dog fights that occured in the skies above him, witnessing plane engines on fire and crashing to the ground. 
					</p>
					<p>
						George Perrin was born in Portsmouth in 1932. As a child he was evacuated and forced to live with a lady who he despised, and who did not treat him well shortly after moving to bournemouth. Like Ron, George was able to hear the explosions which occured miles away. Him and his friend went on their bikes to ride down to the Metropole where they witnessed the awful damage of the bombings. Despite the dead bodies being moved, the carnage still remained.

						I feel like that raid did have quite an effect on all of us; there were a lot of Canadians staying in the Metropole that were trying to help us during the war. So in a way I think it brought the two countries closer together really. The Bournemouth people all had a lot of consideration and respect for the Canadians that got killed. So I suppose it helped in that way, but it was a tragedy. I think it did cement relations, people felt a lot of sympathy for the Canadians after this happened.

When that hit that was a terrific explosion and that was 2 miles away from where we were and that flattened the school and damaged many of the buildings in the area. Can you imagine the chaos caused by loads of them dropping. Especially during the day, that's why the Metropole was so devastating.

				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>
					John Creswell was only four in 1943 when the Metropole bombings began. He was just a child, sitting in his back garden when he witnessed planes fly across the skyline. There had been no air raid warning, but him and a few others decided to immediately go to the raid shelter. After staying some time, they eventurally left and could see smoke rise from Bournemouth center. He recounts it being one of the worst sights anyone could have witnessed. Most of the air raids would be at night time, and so as a child he was not concious of a mid-day attack. This event in partiuclar had a deep affect on John, as he can still remember the bombings vividly today. The main attack which is widely remembered is of the Metropole hotel, however 24 other bombs had also been dropped, causing wide-spread destruction across bournemouth. As a historian, his research found that the pilots had a plan of places they targetted to bomb, all of them being large buildings where many people were present. This bombings still resonate today with the reminders of war torn buildings.

					<p>My name is John Creswell, in 1943 I was 4 years old and I witnessed the air raid on Bournemouth on May 23rd. Me and my immediate family were sitting in our back garden of our house in Southbourne when suddenly we saw a whole load of planes going across the skyline. One of our colleagues recognised them as German planes, and we all went into the air raid shelter immediately. There had been no air raid warning and it was only after we got the all clear that we came out again and apparently the whole road were looking westward to see the smoke rising from Bournemouth centre. It had been the worst raid on Bournemouth. It was a daylight raid and it was the worst one on Bournemouth. </p>

					<p>I’m lucky enough to be able to say I don’t know anyone that lost their lives that day. I did know a neighbour that was affected by the bombings, her store (Bobby’s) was bombed. She used to work there, they had a sale after it was bombed. She would’ve had to help out with the sale and then clear off and man herself.</p>

					<p>The closest bomb would’ve been about 3 miles away, we never actually heard the bombs fall or anything like that. Technically they were quite low weight bombs, but because they were so accurately aimed they caused the huge destruction.</p>

					<p>luckily the raid didn't affect us to much because we didn’t really use the centre, at the time you didn’t travel to far away. We got our shopping locally and didn’t do any serious shopping like people do today, so we didn’t have any knowledge of what happened in the square. We had to rely on the newspapers to get information.</p>

				<div class="transcript storySection">
					<p>The Metropole is the only raid that I remember well, though there were plenty of air raids. Most of them were night time raids so they didn’t really affect us, apart from a few incendiary bombs. So I was never really conscious of any other bombing during the war. However because this has been so etched in the psyche of everyone that lived in Bournemouth and Poole at the time we all recognised it for the great destruction it caused. </p>

					<p>On that particular day the bombing was quite wide ranging, everyone concentrates on the Metropole hotel as being the main event, but there were at least 24 other bombs which were dropped. Ranging from Queens Park all the way along through Boscombe, coming up to Lansdowne and then towards Grand Central. Considering the radius that the bombs fell, it would seem the Germans had some concept of what they were going to bomb, and that is; large corner building several stories high with domes on top. There were three such places and they all got bombed. The Metropole was the main one, it was the first one on their route, they went down, bombed Beales (the store), and then they went on to go to Central hotel where there were more known casualty’s than the Metropole. The reason you hear about the metropole was because most of the casualties were air force personnel, and that got kept secret at the time. We still don’t know what the true figures were, the true casualties, and by that I mean death that the Metropole was.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="storyMedia storySection" style="background-image:url(images/john/houseold.jpeg);">
					<span><h6>"These were called tip and run raids"</h6></span>
				</div> 

					 <div class="transcript storySection">
					<p>They were a different breed to the normal type of bomber that we’d experienced before the blitz. Whereas before the war, the Germans had developed very fast fighter bombers, that could creep in very quickly. They were a one engine job. I don’t think it could outrun a spitfire, but because they came in under the radar by the time the spitfires had come to attack them they were too far across the channel to attack. There was one instance in which one was shot down; though there’s a bit of doubt over whether it was shot down by a spitfire or an anti-air gun. But basically they came in dropped their bombs and flew out as they only had one bomb. These were called tip and run raids, and they were practising these all down the south coast of England. The same day as the Metropole there was a raid on Hastings, but they just used 26 of these planes, they flew in and flew out again.</p>

						 <p>I think the shape of the German bombers made them more recognisable; Germans tended to be more angled, they looked very different to the Americans planes that we’d occasionally see flying over. These were new beasts though so people weren’t as aware of them. An ordinary person probably wouldn’t have recognised them. They had an insignia but you needed to be quite close up to see it.</p>

					<span><h6>"There are a lot of conspiracy theories going on as to what and why they attacked"</h6></span>
				</div> 

				<div class="transcript storySection">
					<p>I think on this occasion the Germans had a specific reason to bomb Bournemouth. There are a lot of conspiracy theories going on as to what and why they attacked. One of the theories is that the three places I mentioned were not the only places bombed. There was a coach firm up on Holdenhurst road, which got very seriously damaged; it was thought that they were making torpedoes up there. So that could very well have been the target. But my personal theory is that three of the buildings hit all had a very similar shape, and were located on Junctions. They were quite tall and they were hotels with military servicemen held up. </p>

						 <p>It was well known that various servicemen were stationed in Bournemouth. We had quite a bit of the American army and Canadian Air Force staying here. The Germans probably did know about us. In a previous raid we had Lord HawHaw who was the sort of propaganda English person on German radio, he’d mentioned an Anglo smith hotel that was going to be bombed so they must have known that servicemen were staying here. Lot of places that got hit in this and other raids were obviously aimed at personnel. But otherwise a lot of the bombing was random.</p>

				<div class="storyMedia storySection" style="background-image:url(images/john/bournemouthbomb.jpg);">
					<span><h6>"They didn’t rebuild much during the war"</h6></span>
				</div>

				<div class="transcript storySection">
					<p> As Bobby’s (The Store) was concerned they bounced back quite quickly in the square. The Shamrock and Rambler coach station got rebuilt quite quickly. But the hotels themselves were left derelict until way after the war. Beale’s was totally operational again. It was the middle of the 1950s before the Metropole became the Kentucky fried chicken place. There was a great reluctance to rebuild things like hotels because they’d served their purpose during and before the war. Because they were a luxury and more people wanted houses, all the concentration was on rebuilding homes for soldiers when they returned.</p>

						 <p>As far as any bombing raid was concerned, they didn’t rebuild much during the war. There wasn’t much effort to rebuild places unless they were very important. And because during and even after the war there was a shortage of building resources, the concentration was primarily on houses and very important places. So places of entertainment or leisure were very low on the list so it probably took quite a while for Bournemouth to reinstate itself as a holiday resort.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="storyMedia storySection" style="background-image:url(images/john/youngboy.jpeg);">
					<span><h6>"This is the raid that really impacts with everybody and still resonates with us"</h6></span>
				</div>

				 <div class="transcript storySection">
					<p>As far as Bournemouth is concerned locally bombing was very restricted. Most of the Germans were still attacking the Russians, and the eastern front. So all we were getting were rather, smaller fighter bombers used in raids, and as far as Bournemouth is concerned this was raid number 48. Of 50, 51 raids altogether. By this time in the war we had very few raids. And this was one of two hit and run raids in this area, in Bournemouth. Technically they were very small scale raids, the damage as you can still see from the pictures were devastating.</p>

					<p>I’ve said from the beginning, anyone that remembers that raid remembers that, and probably not any of the others. Which is even though, there family were killed or injured this is the raid that really impacts with everybody and still resonates with us.  </p>

					<p>I think that younger people unless you’ve experienced what happened in the war, or actually experienced bombing. They have no real concept and I think it’s a tragedy that we can watch the people in Syria, and not realise the agony that the people there must be going through due to constant bombing. We never had that sort of affect in this country, not to the consistency that we see today. When a bomb fell we just carried on afterwards, it was affectively the morale. To keep calm, and carry on.</p>

					<h4>Summary</h4>

						Sunday May 23 1943 was perhaps the worst day of the war in Bournemouth. A squadron of the Luftwaffe’s Focke Wulfes had bombed the town, leading to a terrible loss of life in just a few minutes. It is estimated that the number killed in Bournemouth on that day ranged from 70 to 200 people, with the addtion of twenty two destroyed buildings and a further 3,354 damaged. Mike Brown was just six years old when the bombs hit, whilst his father was away fighting at the war. He was playing with his friend when the sirens began, but due to the frequent nature of them he continued playing. It was not until the sound of the bombs could be felt and heard that he decided to run into the house, shortly after his mother had been calling for him. The buildings targeted that day included Cairns House; West’s Cinema; the Metropole Hotel at the Lansdowne; the Central Hotel at Richmond Hill; the Shamrock and Rambler coach station at Holdenhurst Road; and Beales department store. There had been incidents before, a total of 47. Bombs had been dropped, leading to devisation across bournemouth, but it had not been as horrific as the events that unfolded on 23 May 1943. It is a day that few will forget.

						My name’s Mike Brown I was born in Bournemouth 1937 prior to the start of the Second World War. I haven’t moved much anyway as where I’m living right now is close to where I was born, as people were born in their homes then not in hospital. So I haven’t moved to far from where we experienced the Second World War.
					</p>
					<p>My father went through Normandy, so obviously dad was away and I didn’t see much of him on a regular basis, but he did come home on leave sometimes. Dad was involved in the Second World War and we were doing what we could at home. Dodging them bombs. Luckily no members of my family lost their lives in the war, my Dad and all his brothers all fought in the war; Navy and Army. My sisters were doing work on the railway. </p>

						I was with the lad next door and the siren went. Of course we were used to sirens going, I wouldn’t say we ignored it but sometimes it didn’t affect us. We had a general siren for the whole of the south of England so we just carried on a bit. Anyway my mum came to the French doors of this porch and she said to us that we ‘better come on in’. Well we carried on a bit, and while we were doing that there were five explosions. Well my little feet went as far as they could and I was hammering on the front door before I knew it. This is when the planes went right across Bournemouth centre. We lost Woolworths, the next one went on Richmond memorial church which is on Richmond Hill. Then another one dropped a bomb on Beale’s the department store and the next one although there’s no sign of it now it was West Pitchers Cinema where my Mum used to be work as an usher. The next one was the metropole, which was terrible.

						The closest bombs fell in the town centre, I suppose town centre from Mooredown is 3 miles but even at that distance we still felt it. It was quite a heavy impact and of course we were six years old so we had no idea about the explosives, but it was frightening to me at that age. 
					</p>
					<p>At six years old you’re starting to get wise to different things, I mean we had an air aid shelter in the bungalow. One of those table like designs with metal around them, so we used to get inside that. But I wouldn’t say that it was getting blasé, but I would say we had a rough idea as to what was going on. Obviously my Dad was disappearing off for periods of time which was obviously something I clearly recorded in my mind. </p>
					<p>We had bombs all around; it wasn’t just five bombs I think. I read that on that particular day 16 aircraft were involved not necessarily in bombing the Metropole but they were definitely attacking the area, so it wasn’t until after the day that details started to come in.</p>

					 The bombs left lots of holes all round different areas I mean it wasn’t just the centres. I mean a lot of places in the residential area were bombed as well, I mean on one particular raid a landmine went down on one of the schools that my mother attended on Alma Road. I’m not sure of the force of it but a lot of buildings in the surrounding area were affected by it, because this was a landmine, a big bomb, it damaged a lot of buildings all through the town.
					</p>
					<p>At six years of age I was only affected by the actual bombs dropping, it did mean that we didn’t travel to far though as sometimes the infrastructure for travel was sometimes disrupted. I know there was a big hole where Woolworths used to be for a good few years after it was bombed. We had tanks with machine guns rolling through the town, and planes that came up from a certain airport that was right behind North of Bournemouth, probably a reason for them targeting the area. This airport would probably have been quite an interesting place for the Germans with all the fighter planes being stored there.  </p>
					<p>I suppose we got a bit blasé, we used to collect shrapnel. Because for everything that went up and exploded, well there was a lot of it coming down as well. Well anyways just a ways next to the school that I attended there was a wood and all of the Americans getting ready for D-Day were stationed there. We used to go up there as the tanks were going by on the road, we used to say ‘got any gum chap’ and the yanks used to chuck us some. </p>

				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>
				Vernon Masterman had always lived in Bournemouth, and remained in his childhood house even after it had been damaged from Bournemouth bombings in 1943. He was a mere 4 and a half years old when he was playing in his backyard lawn whilst his father was gardening and mother cooking the sunday roast. After hearing loud noises, he looked up to find a large group of planes flying overhead. His mother came and grabbed his arm, rushing towards the air raid shelter that was further down the street. </p>
				<p>
				They didn't make it to the shelter as they were stopped by flying debris from a blast at the side of the neighbouring building. They were trapped under the building for hours whilst they waited to be dug out. The bomb was aimed at the nerby railway bridge, but had ricochet across the town before detonating next door. Ever sincee these harrowing events, the smell of rubble and burnt building structures still remind him of the day those many years ago. Being a child, his memories of the war were an adventure, he had no fear. Despite the awful events, Vernon still remembers the fun he had across the area as a child, but the reminders of the war still remain.

					<p>Well I was actually born in this house, so I was 4 and a half years old and I was playing just on the lawn there with I think a box of sand or something, and I heard a noise and looked up. My father was up the garden, gardening, my mother was cooking the Sunday dinner and looked around over there. There was about 7 planes coming in really apparently I didn’t know until later there was probably 20 odd but they divided into 3 batches. And with that, mother came and grabbed me and went out through the gate to an air raid shelter which was just on the other side.</p>

					<p>Well we never got there because she saw sort of the blast come in past the edge of the building so she stopped dead and the building collapsed around us, trapping us there for several hours till we were dug out. The bomb was not actually aimed for this spot, it actually aimed for the railway bridge and it ricochet on the slope of the bridge and ricochet took off again and there was a co-op bakery which was that block of flats over there. And it ricochets through the roof across here and it detonated next door. That’s why there are three or four new houses or fairly new houses there. Anyway; the buildings collapsed around us, we were trapped and the side of our house was blown out, eventually we were dug out. I can vaguely remember everything seemed to be pink, it was some memory of pinkness while I was in there and ever since then the smell of rubble, of a building being pulled down gets in my nostrils and that’s a feeling that has always stayed with me for that day. </p>

					<p>That’s the bit I remember, a crew came to dig us out and the Salvation Army turned up with a mobile canteen, so I stood outside and for several hours eating ham rolls. But luckily my uncle has a little haulage business, he got most of his furniture taken up to his place and stored, so some of our furniture got stored as well. After that I slept at my grandmother’s for the night and a few days later we moved into a requisition property, so we went in with several other families, and shared a large house for 5 months before returning to our house as we managed to get the building repaired.  </p>

					<p>The other buildings were completely destroyed. The amazing thing was the house next door where the air raid shelter was completely flattened. When it was all cleared the only thing that remained standing was the outside toilet, hence the expression, built like a brick outhouse. That was it.</p>

					<p>There was one young girl, she was in the air raid shelter and she actually returned to the house to get her dog but she died. And there was another person but I don’t quite recall them as I was very young. The girl ‘Betty’ was only 17, she got killed and she was buried in Boscombe cemetery. That was about it I think. </p>

					<p>I’d probably have called it an adventure as a child because as a child you seem to have no fear. I know my cousin who now lives on the Isle of Wight said she’ll never forget seeing me that day as she only lived a few roads away. She said they dug me out all covered in powder and rubble and dust. Strangely enough it had had an effect on my life, not in any respect but with a different context as a result of going into the council rehousing me. My father became friends with the housing manager, he ended up giving me the chance to have an apprenticeship as a carpenter and that sort of made, set my life up, a stepping stone in my life.  </p>
					<p>Residents stayed mainly the same after the war around here, several other houses had damage but they basically stayed the same. It was only in the later years that people had started moving on and all. But my father’s shop was a shoe shop and that remained a shoe shop for many years. Next door was an ire mongers and the house again was a café. Those businesses moved up onto the main road, they never returned to commercial premise, that was a result of the bombing raid here. Nothing really changed in that respect.</p>

					<p>The only other thing I can remember further on in the war was D-day, when the sky was black with air crafts going over to Normandy beaches, it was absolutely black that morning. And I could always remember my father saying somebody’s getting a packet today and that was about it. And apart from the cinema up the road burning out was probably the last air raid that rocky picture house at the top of the road had an incendiary bomb dropped in, in 1944 I believe that was probably the last air raid on Bournemouth. </p>

					<p>But the one on the 23rd of May was a massive one, the place was really targeted as opposed to the occasional bombs being dropped from aircraft returning from the south midlands back across to the channel. Incidentally; Hastings was targeted as well on the same day May the 23rd 1943 though I don’t think Hastings had as much devastation as Bournemouth. They were two identical, what they call, tip and run raids. </p>

				<div class="transcript storySection">
					<p>I didn’t realise how much devastation it had caused elsewhere in the town because I never moved from the spot. The next building down the road was bombed, incidentally I found out after about 4 – 5 years ago that my wife’s best friend; her aunt, as well as her cousin were killed in the same place down the road. There’s a photo of that devastation but I could never yet find a photo of this spot. </p>

					<p>One thing that was built after the war here was a static water tank next door, which was a large tank probably metal with a concrete base around 6-foot-high, full of water for fire purposes if there was further bombing. And they had that, so that if the water mains got blown up, the fire brigade had water that they could pump on fires. But that was put temporarily next door. It ended up as a good play site for us kids, that area of land there. We had fun out there for years until they rebuilt. But then we’d grown up out of playing around then. </p>

				 <div class="transcript storySection">
					<p>My original house was actually made up of two houses, when we were bombed we made it into one. My father had one staircase taken out, and knocked a doorway through downstairs as well as upstairs. So basically we had many outside doors, we had two front doors that was why sometimes you didn’t know which side of the house to come in, and it was a shop as well. I think the other people never came back; they only had maybe a room or two up above on one side because the shop occupied most of that side of the property. So the result of the bombing was the conversion of this house from two houses to one. </p>

					<p>Despite all that, I’ve never felt like moving from this house. It’s so handy being here. I know it’s not reputed as being a good area but it’s so handy, you’ve got the station, the beach, the main road; you can be away down in the town in minutes, or go straight over into Boscombe. Plus there’s a lovely little pub up the road. I’m content here, I think they’d have to carry me out.  </p>
